# Artificial Neural Network

A simple Python script showing how the backpropagation algorithm works on the construction of artificial neural network.

<!-- ## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

<!-- ###Data Format

* The program read four arguments from the command line â€“ complete path of the training dataset, complete path of the validation dataset, complete path of the test dataset, and the pruning factor.

* The datasets can contain any number of Boolean attributes and one Boolean class label. The
class label will always be the last column.

* The first row will define column names and every subsequent non-blank line will contain a
data instance. If there is a blank line, your program should skip it

* The example of datasets will be provided in [data_sets1](data_sets1) -->

<!-- ### Prerequisites

## Deployment

### Packages -->
<!-- *numpy - N-dimensional array computing
*csv - .cvs file reading
*sys - arguments reading
*copy - data copying
*random - random number generating
*math - scientific computing -->

<!-- ### Functions -->

## Future Works
1. Input data pre-processing
2. Arguments reading
